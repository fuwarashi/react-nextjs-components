#Both Part A and Part B is in one file in index.html and one in App.js

Part A is mostly console based but I included the even handler as one of the features.
-Mostly built on regular javascript, html and css file with no

Part B is mostly using Reactjs and a bunch of messy coding was involved but everything worked out in the end.
-Made seperate jsx files for the WelcomeCard, Counter, and StudentInfo but uses one card css file to unify the design
